## Installation and usage

Be sure, you have installed all dependencies and applications to run React Native project on your computer : [Getting Started with React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).

This project works fine for iOS but in Android version there are serious UI problems because I've only worked on iOS.

### Running the project

Clone this repository :

```
git clone https://github.com/regisnut/IMDB.git
cd IMDB
```

Install packages :

```
npm install
```

When installation is complete, run with version of your choice :

```bash
react-native run-ios
# or
react-native run-android
```
